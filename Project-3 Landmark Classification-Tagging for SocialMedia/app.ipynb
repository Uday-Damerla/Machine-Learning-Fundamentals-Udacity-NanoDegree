    "> <img src=\"static_images/icons/noun-info-2558213.png\" alt=\"?\" style=\"width:25px\"/> Note how we are not importing anything from our source code (we do not use any module from the ``src`` directory). This is because the exported model, differently from the model weights, is a standalone serialization of our model and therefore it does not need anything else. You can ship that file to anybody, and as long as they can import ``torch``, they will be able to use your model. This is very important for releasing pytorch models to production.\n",

    "### Test your app\n",
    "Go to a search engine for images (like Google Images) and search for images of some of the landmarks, like the Eiffel Tower, the Golden Gate Bridge, Machu Picchu and so on. Save a few examples locally, then upload them to your app to see how your model behaves!\n",
    "\n",
    "The app will show the top 5 classes that the model think are most relevant for the picture you have uploaded"
